Dolphins are one of the most beloved and iconic animals on the planet. They are highly social and intelligent creatures that are found in all of the worldâ€™s oceans. Dolphins vary in size and color, but typically have a streamlined body shape for efficient swimming, a powerful tail for propulsion, and a thick layer of blubber for insulation. They have a well-developed sense of hearing and eyesight, as well as a unique blowhole that serves as their nostril.

Dolphins are highly intelligent animals with complex communication systems. They use whistles and clicks to communicate, and can recognize signature whistles of others. Dolphins also use body language to communicate, and can learn to mimic sounds. They live in pods of up to 12 individuals and communicate to coordinate hunting and other activities. Dolphins feed on fish and squid, and use echolocation to hunt.

Dolphins are found in a variety of habitats, including coastal waters, estuarine systems, temperate and tropical oceans, open ocean habitats, abyssal ocean habitats, and river and lake habitats. However, dolphins are vulnerable to human activities and their habitats are threatened by pollution, overfishing, and habitat destruction. To protect dolphins and their habitats, there are a number of conservation efforts that include protecting dolphin habitats, education and awareness, regulatory enforcement, research and monitoring, reducing human impact, and establishing sanctuaries.

People can interact with dolphins in a variety of ways, including swimming with them, petting them, feeding them, watching them in their natural habitat, learning about dolphin behavior, and participating in dolphin research. Dolphins are also highly intelligent creatures with complex social behaviors, problem-solving abilities, and the use of tools and active learning. They also have unique signature whistles, self-awareness, and an advanced memory. Dolphins are protected by international law and are incredibly important members of our planet's ecosystems.

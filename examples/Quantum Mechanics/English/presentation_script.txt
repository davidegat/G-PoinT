In conclusion, Quantum Mechanics is a field of physics that deals with the behavior of matter and energy at the subatomic level. It is based on the principles of wave-particle duality, uncertainty, superposition, entanglement, and Heisenberg's matrix mechanics. Wave-Particle Duality states that matter and energy can exhibit both wave and particle properties. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that it is impossible to measure both the position and momentum of a particle simultaneously. The Schr√∂dinger Equation is a wave-mechanical equation that describes how the quantum state of a system evolves over time. Superposition states are wave-like behavior of particles, where particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously. Entanglement is a phenomenon of non-locality, where particles are connected in a way that they can influence each other instantaneously, no matter the distance between them. Quantum tunneling is a phenomenon where electrons can travel through barriers they do not have enough energy to cross. Finally, quantum computing is a form of computing that utilizes quantum mechanics principles and employs qubits instead of bits.
